DCPU-16 emulator and assembler written in Java with a Swing front-end.

Latest Changes:

 * Added disassembly window
 * changed CPU to use notch's cpu implementation (it will run the demo at http://dcpu.com/highnerd/ - you can load it from test/mem.dmp)

GUI layout's still a bit rough, but it's ready for serious work (with care)

To use.

You will need gradle installed to run the build.
Running "gradle run" will start the emulator.  There are three menu options at the moment:

If you don't want to install gradle, there is a pre-built binary, to run:

java -jar build/libs/dcpu.jar

File>Load - will load a hex dump (see the test directory for examples)
File>Run - will run the emulation. A trace of the CPU running is written to sysout.
File>Assemble - will assemble a file and put the resulting .hex file in the same directory as the dasm16 file

Started work on message based runtime for DCPU-16 - should help shake out a few more bugs (see OS directory for details)

TODO:
 * Add floppy disk support (when there are some more details)
 * Remove old display window from gui
 * Add include to assembler
