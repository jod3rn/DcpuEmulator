DCPU-16 emulator and assembler written in Java with a Swing front-end.

This is a very early version which does display the DCPU screen
I'm not entirely sure it's correct, since i've only got Notch's
sample program to go from.

To use.

You will need gradle installed to run the build.
Running "gradle run" will start the emulator.  There are three menu options at the moment:

If you don't want to install gradle, there is a pre-built binary, to run:

java -jar build/libs/dcpu.jar

File>Load - will load a hex dump (see the test directory for examples)
File>Run - will run the emulation. A trace of the CPU running is written to sysout.
File>Assemble - will assemble a file and put the resulting .hex file in the same directory as the dasm16 file

TODO:
 * Add better keyboard support.
 * Add floppy disk support (when there are some more details)
 * Better error handling
